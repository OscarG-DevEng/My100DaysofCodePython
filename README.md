# My 100 Days of Code Python
Here, I showcase the exercises and projects I have completed in the course '100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp' by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. This directory will be divided by days, as it is in the course. I am taking this course to learn the Python programming language, which will be useful for future projects.
